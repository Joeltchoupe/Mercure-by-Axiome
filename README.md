# Mercure by Axiome

**The Agent Operating System for Shopify.**

Mercure transforms Shopify stores from fragmented stacks of apps into unified, intelligent, autonomous commerce machines.

This is not another plugin.

This is the nervous system of AI commerce.

---

# Vision

Commerce is entering a new era.

The previous era was defined by tools.

- Email tools
- Analytics tools
- Support tools
- Ad tools
- Inventory tools

Each tool operates in isolation. Each tool sees a fragment of reality.

The merchant becomes the integration layer.

The merchant becomes the bottleneck.

Mercure replaces fragmented tools with coordinated intelligence.

Mercure is the orchestration layer that turns a Shopify store into an AI-native business.

Our long-term vision is simple:

> Mercure becomes the operating system that powers autonomous commerce globally.

Just as Shopify abstracted infrastructure, Mercure abstracts decision-making.

---

# Mission

Transform any Shopify store into an AI-powered, self-optimizing commerce system.

Without requiring migration.

Without replacing existing tools.

Without breaking existing workflows.

Mercure connects to the store and becomes the intelligence layer above everything.

---

# The Problem

A typical €1M Shopify store runs on:

- Shopify (core)
- Klaviyo (email)
- Gorgias (support)
- Meta Ads + Google Ads
- Analytics tools
- Inventory tools
- Multiple Shopify apps

None of these systems share intelligence.

Consequences:

- Ad spend optimized for short-term ROAS, not long-term profit
- Support disconnected from customer lifetime value
- Email flows unaware of real customer sentiment
- Inventory decisions made with incomplete data
- Founder trapped in operational decision loops

Scaling increases complexity faster than revenue.

---

# The Solution

Mercure introduces a new architecture:

**Agent Orchestration Layer**

Mercure connects to Shopify and existing tools, aggregates all signals, and deploys coordinated AI agents.

These agents:

- Observe the entire system
- Share intelligence
- Execute decisions autonomously
- Continuously optimize business performance

Mercure does not replace tools.

Mercure orchestrates them.

---

# Core Principles

## 1. Orchestration over Replacement

Mercure integrates with the existing stack.

No migration required.

Mercure becomes the intelligence layer above Shopify.

---

## 2. Intelligence over Automation

Automation executes predefined rules.

Mercure executes decisions based on live context.

Mercure continuously learns and adapts.

---

## 3. System-Level Optimization

Most tools optimize locally.

Mercure optimizes globally.

Every decision considers:

- Profit
- Customer lifetime value
- Inventory constraints
- Customer sentiment
- Acquisition cost

---

## 4. Human in Control, Not in the Loop

Mercure executes operational decisions autonomously.

The merchant focuses only on strategic decisions.

---

# Architecture Overview

Mercure consists of four main layers:

Shopify Store ↓ Mercure Integration Layer ↓ Mercure Agent Orchestration Engine ↓ Mercure Intelligence Layer (AI Agents)

---

# Core Components

## 1. Shopify Integration Layer

Responsible for:

- OAuth authentication
- Secure token management
- Webhook ingestion
- Real-time event synchronization

Events include:

- Orders
- Customers
- Products
- Inventory
- Fulfillment
- Checkouts

---

## 2. Data Normalization Layer

Transforms raw Shopify data into structured intelligence.

Creates unified models:

- Customer profiles
- Order histories
- Product performance metrics
- Behavioral timelines

---

## 3. Agent Orchestration Engine

Coordinates all Mercure agents.

Responsibilities:

- Context aggregation
- Decision routing
- Agent coordination
- Conflict resolution

This is the core brain of the system.

---

## 4. Agent Layer

Specialized AI agents execute specific business functions.

Examples:

### Acquisition Agent

Optimizes:

- Campaign allocation
- Audience targeting
- Creative performance

Based on profit, not ROAS.

---

### Conversion Agent

Optimizes:

- Product pages
- Offers
- Messaging

Based on visitor context.

---

### Retention Agent

Optimizes:

- Customer lifetime value
- Repeat purchase probability
- Winback timing

Based on behavioral signals.

---

### Operations Agent

Optimizes:

- Inventory planning
- Demand forecasting
- Cash flow efficiency

---

### Support Agent

Handles:

- Customer inquiries
- Order tracking requests
- Returns and refunds

Escalates only when necessary.
